"""Object-level authorization guards (defense against IDOR).

The app-wide auth gate in main.py guarantees a request is *authenticated*; these
helpers enforce that the authenticated user actually *owns* the resource they
name by id. That matters because a single backend can be shared by a team
(see services.user._mirror_team_users / is_team users), so more than one user's
rows can live in one database.

Ownership chain in the schema:
    users(user_id)
      ├─ target_models(model_id, user_id)
      └─ classifiers(classifier_id, user_id, model_id NULLABLE)
                └─ rule_setup(setup_id, classifier_id)

A classifier (UI "guardrail") is owned DIRECTLY by a user via classifiers.user_id
(added in schema v15). That decoupling matters because a guardrail can exist
before a model is chosen — model_id is NULL until the user attaches one at train
time — so ownership can no longer be derived through the model.

Cognitive elements and the public `rules` registry have NO per-user owner column
(they are shared libraries), so they are protected by authentication alone — not
by these guards.

Guards raise 404 (not 403) on a miss so they don't leak whether an id exists to a
user who isn't allowed to see it.
