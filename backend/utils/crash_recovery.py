"""Crash recovery — runs on server startup to clean up stale/orphaned state.

Implemented as a Strategy pattern (GoF): each `RecoveryStrategy` subclass owns
one isolated recovery workflow. The orchestrator iterates a list of strategies
without caring what any of them does, and one strategy failing never prevents
the next one from running.

Adding a new recovery type:
  1. Subclass `RecoveryStrategy` with a `name` and a `run()` method.
  2. Append an instance to `RECOVERY_STRATEGIES`.
No changes to `run_all_recovery` or to existing strategies are required.

Currently registered:
  1. Guardrails stuck in 'training' status (server crashed during training)
     → Reset to previous status, delete partial training files
  2. Test datasets stuck in 'generating' status (server crashed during generation)
     → Mark as 'error'
  3. Orphaned guardrail directories with no matching DB record
     → Delete files
