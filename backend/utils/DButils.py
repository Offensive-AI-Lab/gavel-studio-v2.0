# Bump this constant whenever init_database adds / removes / alters a

# short-circuits init_database in <50ms instead of hitting Postgres
# for every CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS.
#
# Version log (informal — the actual source of truth is git history):
#   1  initial schema (users, rules, ces, classifiers, ...)
#   2  bookmarks tables + sync_state
#   3  registry-link columns + crash-recovery flags
#   4  rule_calibration_datasets + categories
#   5  Phase 1 of artist feature: CITEXT username, ratings, summaries
#   6  scenarios table + scenario_id FK on rules and test_datasets
#   7  pipeline_runs table (wizard state persistence for the 8-step
#      rule-creation flow)
#   8  pipeline_runs split into two flavors — Pipeline A (rule generation,
#      classifier-agnostic) and Pipeline B (test + evaluation, per-rule).
#      classifier_id is now nullable; new pipeline_type column.
#   9  Rule-level default test/calibration datasets. test_datasets gains
#      rule_id / user_id / is_default + HF registry columns (public_id,
#      published_at, pending_public_id); classifier_id becomes nullable.
#      The `scenarios` table and all scenario_id FKs are removed — the
#      scenario now lives inside test_datasets.config (scenario_instructions)
#      and, while editing, in pipeline_runs.steps.
#  10  test_datasets fully decoupled from classifiers: classifier_id column
#      dropped. A test set is now purely rule-scoped — a public default
#      (is_default=TRUE) or a user's private custom set (user_id set). Test
#      dialogues are classifier-agnostic, so the classifier link added
#      nothing.
#  11  target_models gains an optional hf_token (some models are gated /
#      private and need a Hugging Face token to download).
#  12  classifiers gain trained_policy_fingerprint — a content hash of the
#      policy a model was trained on, so 'needs_retraining' is computed from
#      real drift (current policy != trained policy) instead of a sticky flag.
#  13  neutral_corpus table (shared benign-conversation corpus for neutral-set
#      evaluation, keyed by content_hash + category). It was added to the DDL
#      block below WITHOUT a version bump, so DBs already at v12 took the
#      fast-path skip and never created it ("relation neutral_corpus does not
#      exist"). This bump forces the idempotent CREATE TABLE to run on next boot.
#   v14: added `bundle_jobs` (server-side export/import background jobs) — the
#      fast-path skip would otherwise never create it on existing DBs.
#   v15: classifiers gain a direct `user_id` owner column. Guardrails (the UI
#      name for classifiers) can now exist BEFORE a model is chosen, so the
#      old "owner derived through model_id" chain no longer holds. user_id is
#      backfilled from target_models for existing rows; model_id stays nullable
#      so an unattached guardrail can hold a rule set until train time.
#   v16: guardrail folders — an optional "library" grouping over guardrails.
#      New `guardrail_folders` table (per-user, named); `folder_id` on
#      classifiers. (v16 originally shipped an auto-arrange experiment —
#      `policy_sig` + a `guardrail_auto_arrange` flag — dropped in v17.)
#   v17: folders are purely MANUAL. Auto-arrange removed (policy_sig +
#      guardrail_auto_arrange columns dropped). Deleting a folder now
#      CASCADE-deletes the guardrails inside it (was ON DELETE SET NULL) — the
#      product decision is that removing a folder removes its guardrails.
#   v18: per-model LLM layer selection — target_models gains `num_layers` (total
#      transformer layers, the picker bound) and `selected_layers` (the [start,
#      end) range whose activations train the guardrail). Lets the user pick/edit
#      layers per model; training reads this instead of the global default.
#   v19: public Rule Sets — a model-less rule set (UI "guardrail") can be SHARED
#      to the community. New `rule_sets` table: a named, attributed, model-agnostic
#      collection of already-published rules, carrying the SAME publish-state
#      columns as rules/CEs (public_id, published_at, is_local_draft,
#      pending_public_id, is_ready, created_by_username) so it publishes to + syncs
#      from HF exactly like a rule. New `rule_set_member` join table (which global
#      rules belong to a set, ordered by `position`). The private `classifiers`
#      row stays the authoring source / fork target and is NEVER itself published —
#      publishing mints a separate public record (public_rule_sets/<pid>.json),
#      leaving the private workspace fully editable/deletable.

    # public-library peer of `rules`/`cognitive_elements`: it carries the same
    # publish-state column set (public_id / published_at / is_local_draft /
    # pending_public_id / is_ready / created_by_username) so it publishes to and
    # syncs from HF through the exact same machinery. A public rule set is a
    # thin pointer-collection: `rule_set_member` references already-published
    # GLOBAL rules by rule_id (like rule_ce_link references CEs), so no rule/CE
    # content is duplicated. Created after the citext extension + the rule/CE
    # created_by_username columns so the CITEXT column type resolves.
