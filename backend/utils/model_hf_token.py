"""Resolve the stored HF access token for a model ref.

Shared by every off-box compute backend (SLURM cluster + remote GPU worker):
those machines have no DB of their own, so the backend resolves a gated/private
base model's token HERE (with DB access) at submit time and ships it inside the
private per-job payload. Returns None for public models / no match / any error,
in which case the loader proceeds anonymously (correct for public models).
