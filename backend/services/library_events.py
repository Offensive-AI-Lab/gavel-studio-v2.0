"""In-process event bus: the backend -> frontend live push (one layer down
from the central -> backend control plane).

The central server pushes `version_update` over a WebSocket; the registry
subscriber PROBES whether this backend is behind (without touching the DB) and
calls `set_available()` HERE. The `/library/events` SSE stream fans the resulting
`update_available` / `synced` event out to every connected browser tab, so the
sidebar surfaces a "click to sync" badge the instant an update lands — no
frontend polling, and no silent mid-session DB mutation (the user applies the
update on their click).

Tiny by design: a set of asyncio.Queues (one per connected SSE client) plus a
remembered event loop so `publish()` can be called from the subscriber's worker
THREAD (the probe runs off the loop via asyncio.to_thread) and still hand the
event to the loop safely. A one-field `_state` records the latest availability
so the SSE greet can replay it to a tab that connects after the push.
