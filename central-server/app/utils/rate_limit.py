"""Lightweight in-process per-IP rate limiter (no external dependency).

The central server runs as a single process, so an in-memory sliding-window
counter is enough to blunt floods — a burst of logins that would otherwise pile
up expensive argon2 hashes, or a storm of HF publishes that would tie up the
threadpool. Per client IP, per scope. Thread-safe and memory-bounded.
